## The project
MuSa collects and analyze informations about visitors and their tours and propose them custom journeys, in order to offer a new way to enjoy the art. At the very beginning every user should fill a short survey in order to collect informations about his personality. Then MuSa will ask him if he wants to enjoy a custom tour or just help with data collecting. Of course, the user may also choice to do not use the system at all. When a user wants just to contribuite with data collecting he will start travelling on his own inside the museum with his smartphone collecting data in a non-invasive way inside his pocket. When a user wants to enjoy the tour with MuSa, indeed, he will just start exploring the museum follow the custom suggestions MuSa will show him.
